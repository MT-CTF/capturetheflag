Introduction
------------
This mod adds TNT to Minetest. TNT is a tool to help the player
in mining.

How to use the mod:

Craft gunpowder by placing coal and gravel in the crafting area.
The gunpowder can be used to craft TNT sticks or as a fuse trail for TNT.

To craft 2 TNT sticks:
G_G
GPG
G_G
G = gunpowder
P = paper
The sticks are not usable as an explosive.

Craft TNT from 9 TNT sticks.

There are different ways to ignite TNT:
  1. Hit it with a torch.
  2. Hit a gunpowder fuse trail that leads to TNT with a torch or
     flint-and-steel.
  3. Activate it with mesecons (fastest way).

For 1 TNT:
Node destruction radius is 3 nodes.
Player and object damage radius is 6 nodes.
