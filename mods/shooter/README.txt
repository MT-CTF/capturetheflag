Minetest Mod - Simple Shooter [shooter]
=======================================

Mod Version: 0.5.3

Minetest Version: 0.4.9, 0.4.10, 0.4.11

Depends: default, dye, tnt, wool

An experimental first person shooter mod that uses simple vector mathematics
to produce an accurate and server-friendly method of hit detection.

By default this mod is configured to work only against other players in
multiplayer mode and against Simple Mobs [mobs] in singleplayer mode.

Default configuration can be customised by adding a shooter.conf file to
the mod's main directory, see shooter.conf.example for more details.

This is still very much a work in progress which I eventually plan to use
as the base for a 'Spades' style FPS game using the minetest engine.
