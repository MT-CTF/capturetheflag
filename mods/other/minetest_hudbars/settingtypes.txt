[Appearance]
# Specifies how the value indicators (i.e. health, breah, etc.) look. There are 3 styles
# available. You can choose between the default progress-bar-like bars and the good
# old statbars like you know from vanilla Minetest.
# These values are possible:
#   - progress_bar:    A horizontal progress-bar-like bar with a label, showing numerical value
#                      (current, maximum), and an icon. These bars usually convey the most
#                      information. This is the default and recommended value.
#   - statbar_classic: Classic statbar, like in vanilla Minetest. Made out of up to 20
#                      half-symbols. Those bars represent the vague ratio between
#                      the current value and the maximum value. 1 half-symbol stands for
#                      approximately 5% of the maximum value.
#   - statbar_modern:  Like the classic statbar, but also supports background images, this
#                      kind of statbar may be considered to be more user-friendly than the
#                      classic statbar. This bar type closely resembles the mod
#                      “Better HUD” [hud] by BlockMen.

# If enabled (default), the breath indicators in the HUD will be automatically hidden shortly
# after the breath has been filled up. Otherwise, the breath will always be displayed. 
hudbars_autohide_breath (Automatically hide breath indicators) bool true

# This setting changes the way the HUD bars are ordered on the display. You can choose
# between a zig-zag pattern (default) or a vertically stacked pattern.
# The following values are allowed:
#    - zigzag:     Starting from the left bottom, the next is right from the first,
#                  the next is above the first, the next is right of the third, etc.
#    - stack_up:   The HUD bars are stacked vertically, going upwards.
#    - stack_down: The HUD bars are stacked vertically, going downwards.
hudbars_alignment_pattern (HUD bars alignment pattern) enum zigzag zigzag,stack_up,stack_down

# This setting allows you to specify the order of the HUD bars explicitly. If left empty
# (the default), the health and breath indicators come first, additional indicators
# may appear in any order. This setting is quite technical and normal users probably do not
# need to worry about it.
#
# Syntax:
# The setting has to be specified as a comma-seperated list of key=value pairs, where a key
# refers to the identifier of a HUD bar and the value refers to the slot number of where the
# HUD bar should be placed. The slot number must be an integer greater of equal to 0. Where
# the HUD bars will be displayed exactly depends on the alignment pattern being used.
# All HUD bars to which no order value has been applied will fill in all slots which have
# not been occupied by the HUD bars specified in this setting, the slots will be filled in
# from the lowest slot number.
# Note that the order of those remaining HUD bars is not fixed, it basically just boils
# down on which mod “came” first. Don't worry, the mod will still work perfectly fine, this
# setting is entirely optional.
# The identifier for the health bar is “health” and the identifier for the breath bar is
# “breath”. For other HUD bars, you have to learn it from the mod which is supplying them.
#
# Be careful not to use slot indices twice, or else different HUD bars will be drawn over
# each other!
#
# Example: “breath=0, health=1”
# This makes the breath bar first and the health bar second, which is the opposite order
# of the default one.
