# CTF Map - Map maker

## Creating a new map

### 1. Dependencies

* Minetest 5.0.0 or later.
* `ctf_map` modpack (by copying the folder from this game to `minetest/mods`)
* `worldedit` and `worldedit_commands`.

### 2. Find an area

* Can use Minetest Game and any mapgen.
* It must be a cube, and the barrier will be in the exact center.
* It should be around 230x230 in surface area, but this can be lesser.
* Feel free to modify the area to your needs.

### 3. Select the area

There are multiple ways do this, this is the simplest in most cases.

* If you haven't modified the map at all, do the following to speed up barrier placement:
  * Stop Minetest.
  * Open up the world's world.mt
  * Set backend to "dummy".
  * Save.
* Using worldedit, select the area.
* Type `/gui`, and click "From WE" then "To WE".
* Check that the center location is the right place for the barrier to go.
* Check that the bounds extend far enough.

### 4. Place barriers

* Set the middle barrier direction. The barrier is a plane defined by a co-ordinate = 0.
  If the barrier is X=0, then it will placed with every node of the barrier having X=0.
  If the barrier is Z=0, then it will placed with every node of the barrier having Z=0.
* Click "place barrier". Note that this command does not have an undo.

### 5. Meta data

* Set the meta data

### 6. Export

* Click export, and wait until completion.
* Copy the resultant folder from `worlddir/schems/` into `ctf_map/ctf_map_core/maps/`.
* Profit!

`treasures` is a list of treasures to be registered for this map in serialized format.

An example `treasures` value that registers steel pick, shotgun, and grenade:

```lua
treasures = default:pick_steel,0.5,5,1,10;shooter:shotgun,0.04,2,1;shooter:grenade,0.08,2,1
```
