This is a fork of original TNT game by MTG. The original code is under LGPLv2.1+ and so is this.

The main differences between the original TNT mod and CTF's TNT mod are:

 - CTF TNT does not damage teammates of the placer
 - CTF TNT can be placed only within a radius of enemy flag
 - CTF TNT gives points for blocks removed
 - CTF TNT does not remove unremovable blocks in CTF, such as map borders, flags and chests
