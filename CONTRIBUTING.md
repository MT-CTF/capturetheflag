# Getting Started
It's very easy to set-up a local server in order to test and contribute to 
the development version of this game project.  
The game engine used is free, open source [Luanti](https://www.luanti.org/) formerly known as Minetest.

I would highly recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), for making patches as it has easier source control and a variety of extensions. If you use Visual Studio Code we recommend these extensions:
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dwenegar.vscode-luacheck
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GreenXenith.minetest-tools

### Fork Project
- You can create a clone of the project by using git from the CLI or with the use of a tool like the one recommended above.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MT-CTF/capturetheflag.git
```
- If you dont want to use a CLI, and want a more intitutive GUI based interface I would suggest using [Github Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop). 
- I would recommend you to perform the git clone on a folder inside your Luanti games folder. Something like `\Luanati_5.11\games\capturetheflag_dev`.
  This would make it easier for you to debug your changes.

# Getting Involved

Aditionally it will be very helpful to provide Game screenshots, debug.txt output,etc . 

### Patch Game
