# Getting Started
It's very easy to set-up a local server in order to test and contribute to 
the development version of this game project.  
The game engine used is free, open source [Luanti](https://www.luanti.org/) formerly known as Minetest.

I would highly recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), for cloning the project, creating patches, etc. 

### Fork Project
- You can create a clone of the project by using git from the CLI or with the use of a tool like the one recommended above.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MT-CTF/capturetheflag.git
```
- If you dont want to use a CLI, and want a more intitutive GUI based interface I would suggest using [Github Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop). 
- I would recommend you to perform the git clone on a folder inside your Luanti games folder. Something like `\Luanati_5.11\games\capturetheflag_dev`.
  This would make it easier for you to debug your changes.

# Getting Involved
### Report Issues
If you encounter any problems with this version, you can report them to our GitHub Issue tracker. Very often, it will be very helpful for debugging purposes to fetch game logs when encountering issues.
Aditionally it will be very helpful to provide Game screenshots, debug.txt output,etc . 

### Patch Game
The main coding language used is Lua, feel free to create patches and propose them by making a Pull Request. You should look around on the GitHub Issue tracker for open issues or the `suggestions-note` channel on Discord 
to implement new features on the game. When contributing from suggestions in the Discord server, please make sure the suggestions is not controvertial, and have at least 10 stars. 
You can join the Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/vcZTRPX). If you are a new contributor, feel free to ask the other fellow devs any questions you have. 
If you are just starting out, you can start with just making pull requests fixing minor bugs before submitting major features. 

### New Maps
Not into coding? But more into design? No worries, you can help us out too by creating new and interesting maps. The maps are present on a seperate [Github Repository](https://github.com/MT-CTF/maps/)
